1.  Install the ADK

You will need to install the IBM watsonx Orchestrate Agent Development
Kit (ADK) for the hands-on lab of the ADK. It is packaged as a Python
library and command line tool that allows builders to configure agents
that run on the IBM Watsonx Orchestrate platform. 

Make sure you have Python and pip installed:

- **Python**: The ADK requires at least Python 3.11, and the latest
  compatible version is Python 3.13. For more information, see
  [**Python**](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

- **Pip**: Pip is Python’s package manager. In some operating systems,
  it’s included with Python’s installation. For more information, see
  [**Pip**](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

Then on your local computer open your terminal/ Command prompt and run
the following commands: 

1.  Install the ADK with pip:  

pip install ibm-watsonx-orchestrate 

 

1.  Test the installation: 

orchestrate --version 

 

After installation, you can start using the ADK and its CLI. For more
information on available commands and arguments, use the --help argument
at the end of a command. For example: orchestrate --help. 

1.  Sign up for a ServiceNow Account

For the ADK Lab, you will also need to sign up for a ServiceNow Account
to serve as a backend for the custom tools.

1.  Signup for a Service Now account
    at https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do. 

<!-- -->

1.  Validate your email address (check email). 

2.  On the landing page, click start building. This allocates a new
    instance of ServiceNow for you.

1.  Download and install VSCode

For this lab, you'll need an IDE to modify some configuration files.

We recommend downloading and installing **VS Code** using the following
link:

<https://code.visualstudio.com/download>

Alternatively, feel free to use any IDE you're comfortable with.
